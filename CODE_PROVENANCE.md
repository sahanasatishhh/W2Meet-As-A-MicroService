5. High Level Influence:
    - I used GenAI to decide the scope of my suggestion-service algorithm - I was planning to also make duration a variable and asked the AI on its feasibility - although the AI encouraged me to do it, I thought the response time might be affected and thought to work with a basic version of When2Meet first so ended up not using it.

6. Originality Statement
- I affirm that I understand the course policy on authorized assistance.
- All external and AI assistance is fully documented above.
- I take responsibility for the submitted code and can explain it.
